# bs-d3

WIP [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) 5.x bindings for [Bucklescript](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/).

Extremely incomplete and experimental; contributions welcome!


## Build
```
npm run build
```

## Build + Watch

```
npm run start
```

## Current status

d3 has a large [API surface](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#paths-d3-path), so there's still a lot to do! However, the pieces are already in place to [draw line and area charts](https://github.com/af/bs-d3/blob/master/examples/lineChart.re)

Currently some of the typings are still quite loose/permissive, if you have any suggestions to tighten them up in an idiomatic OCaml way, please file an issue or PR.
